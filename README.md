# Google Code Jam 2018
These are my messy solutions for
[Google Code Jam 2018](https://codejam.withgoogle.com/2018/). Will only update
after each round so no cheating :)

Note that the sample inputs for Senate Evacuation (2016 1C, Prob. A), Steed 2:
Cruise Control (2017 1B, Prob. A), and Bathroom Stalls (2017 Qual, Prob. C) are
from their respective archives.

The solutions, unless indicated, passed all tests.
